# Drunkify-Django

I am assuming you have a python environment already. If not you could easily download PyCharm. 

To run, just open your bash (if you are on windows definitely download git bash and don't use the commander)

And run the following command to clone
```
git clone https://github.com/KhachDavid/Drunkify-Django.git
````

Run this one to download all the dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

And run this command to run the whole program
5000 is the port number.
Spotify API only works with this port.
Also, make sure to sign in with your Spotify account for full functionality
```
py manage.py runserver 5000
```
If this doesn't work try
```
py manage.py runserver 5000
```
